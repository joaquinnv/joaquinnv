For the past 4+ years, I've been building the payment and event management infrastructure at Blackthorn.io, working across the full backend stack — NestJS microservices, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis — designing systems that handle thousands of daily transactions reliably.",

I believe the best engineers are the ones who never stop learning — which is why I'm currently diving into LangChain, LangGraph, and AI Agents.",
